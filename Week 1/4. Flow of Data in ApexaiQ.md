### Flow Diagram.

![[FlowOfData.jpeg]]

The diagram (FlowOfData.jpeg) is represented here as a stepwise data path with inputs, processing, outputs, and controls.

1. **Security Tools (Your Network)**
    
    - **Inputs:** firewalls, EDR/AV, scanners, SIEM, MDM, hypervisors, cloud APIs.
        
    - **Outputs to ApexaiQ:** raw inventories, alerts, posture data.
        
    - **Controls:** API scopes, service accounts, network allowlists.
        
2. **ApexaiQ Collector**
    
    - **What:** Network‑side component that aggregates from local systems.
        
    - **How:** scheduled pulls, event subscriptions; securely forwards through firewall via Accelerator.
        
    - **Controls:** certificate pinning, TLS, credential vaulting, egress rules.
        
    - **Pitfalls:** over‑privileged connectors; missing proxy rules.
        
3. **Pre‑Feed Rules (Automatic)**
    
    - **What:** Clean, normalize, dedupe before landing in the main data store.
        
    - **How:** schema mapping, value standardization, key matching.
        
    - **Outputs:** canonical fields (owner, device ID, OS, version, location).
        
    - **Pitfalls:** over‑aggressive dedupe; loss of source attribution.
        
4. **ApexaiQ Dashboard (SaaS)**
    
    - **What:** Central UI and API for search, analytics, and orchestration.
        
    - **How:** role‑based access control (RBAC), saved views, drill‑downs.
        
    - **Metrics:** user activity, query latency, report freshness.
        
5. **Processed Feed → Devices**
    
    - **What:** Device catalog (endpoints, servers, network/IoT).
        
    - **How:** state tracking (active/inactive), ownership, location, compliance tags.
        
    - **Controls:** uniqueness via hardware IDs + source reconciliation.
        
6. **Processed Feed → Users**
    
    - **What:** Identity mapping (IdP/HRIS) to assets and SaaS entitlements.
        
    - **How:** email/UPN correlation, group membership.
        
    - **Controls:** orphan account detection; leaver processes.
        
7. **Processed Feed → Software**
    
    - **What:** Installations, versions, licenses, SaaS apps per user.
        
    - **How:** normalization to product/catalog entries; EOL/EOS checks.
        
    - **Controls:** black/whitelists; unsupported software flags.
        
8. **Enrich Rules (Your Input)**
    
    - **What:** Custom business logic (tags, criticality, compliance domains).
        
    - **How:** attribute‑based conditions; reference tables (e.g., crown jewels list).
        
    - **Outputs:** enriched records for routing, prioritization, scoring.
        
9. **Accelerator & Integration**
    
    - **Accelerator:** prebuilt connectors, default mappings, starter policies.
        
    - **Integrations:** outbound to ITSM, SOAR, MDM/EDR, config mgmt, CMDB.
        
    - **Controls:** bidirectional sync testing; conflict resolution strategy.
        

**Operational controls across the flow.** Logging, change management, data retention, privacy masking, access reviews, and disaster recovery tests.
