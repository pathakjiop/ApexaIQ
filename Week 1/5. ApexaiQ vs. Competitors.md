The following comparison expands focus areas and evaluation dimensions. Use it to guide a neutral, requirement‑driven assessment.

|Platform|Primary Focus|Typical Strengths|Typical Gaps to Validate|Evaluation Dimensions|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Quod Orbis|Risk & compliance monitoring|Controls mapping, compliance dashboards|ITAM depth, inventory reconciliation|Integration breadth, evidence export, control testing automation|
|Vicarius|Vulnerability remediation|Patch prioritization, remediation workflows|Full inventory/owner context|CVE scoring transparency, patch coverage across OS/app stacks|
|Bionic|Application visibility|App/service mapping, data flows|Full estate ITAM beyond app layer|Runtime coverage, lineage to infra assets|
|Nanitor|Continuous risk assessment|Posture analytics, continuous checks|Automation maturity|Policy authoring UX, exception handling|
|CloudWize|Cloud compliance & visibility|CSPM‑style checks|Non‑cloud/endpoint ITAM|Multi‑cloud parity, IaC integration|
|SMI|Asset intelligence|Insights, enrichment|Real‑time automation|Freshness SLAs, write‑back options|

**ApexaiQ’s edge (to validate in your environment).** Agentless coverage, real‑time posture, and automation depth tied to ITAM‑grade inventory.

**How to evaluate fairly.**

- Define **must‑have** use cases (e.g., unsupported OS eradication in 90 days; SaaS license optimization by 20%).
    
- Score platforms on **data freshness**, **dedupe accuracy**, **policy guardrails**, **auditability**, and **time to first value**.
    
- Run a **pilot** on a realistic subset (e.g., one BU with mixed devices + SaaS + cloud). Capture metrics before/after.
