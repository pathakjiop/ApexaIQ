**ApexaiQ’s edge (to validate in your environment).** Agentless coverage, real‑time posture, and automation depth tied to ITAM‑grade inventory.

**How to evaluate fairly.**

- Define **must‑have** use cases (e.g., unsupported OS eradication in 90 days; SaaS license optimization by 20%).
    
- Score platforms on **data freshness**, **dedupe accuracy**, **policy guardrails**, **auditability**, and **time to first value**.
    
- Run a **pilot** on a realistic subset (e.g., one BU with mixed devices + SaaS + cloud). Capture metrics before/after.
