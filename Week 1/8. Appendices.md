### Appendix A: Week‑1 Practicals and Hands‑On

- **Practical 1:** Connect two authoritative sources (IdP and MDM). Verify user‑to‑device mappings for a pilot group.
    
- **Practical 2:** Define your “crown jewels” list and tag those assets. Set higher SLOs and monitoring.
    
- **Practical 3:** Build an enrichment rule: If OS is past EOL and device is internet‑exposed, set risk to High and notify owner.
    
- **Practical 4:** Create a baseline policy for disk encryption and screen‑lock timers; measure compliance.
    
- **Practical 5:** Pilot one automation: auto‑open ITSM change for unsupported OS; include approval gate.
    
- **Practical 6:** Produce a Week‑1 dashboard: coverage %, stale records %, EOL assets count, average ApexaiQ score by BU.
    

### Appendix B: Sample Policies, Rules, and Playbooks

- **Policy:** Patch SLOs — Critical within 7 days, High within 14 days, Medium within 30 days.
    
- **Rule:** Tag “orphaned” assets if no activity for 30 days and no assigned owner.
    
- **Playbook:** Unsupported OS remediation — notify owner → schedule upgrade → verify → close exception.
    
- **Guardrails:** Automation dry‑run; per‑BU action scopes; change blackout windows.
    

### Appendix C: Dashboards, KPIs, and Reports

- **Coverage Dashboard:** devices/users/software coverage, freshness distribution.
    
- **Risk Dashboard:** EOL count, critical CVEs, baseline violations, average score trend.
    
- **Cost & License:** SaaS utilization %, unused license candidates, renewal calendar.
    
- **Audit Pack:** control mappings, evidence links, exception register, change logs.
