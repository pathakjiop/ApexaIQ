ApexaiQ extends traditional IT Asset Management by adding **real-time visibility, automation, and security assurance**.  
While ITAM ensures assets are inventoried and managed across their lifecycle, ApexaiQ strengthens this foundation by making the data **continuous, accurate, and actionable**.  


**Agentless Approach.**

- **What:** Collects via network, APIs, and platform integrations rather than endpoint agents.
    
- **Why:** Lower end‑user friction, faster rollout, fewer performance concerns on endpoints.
    
- **How:** authenticated connectors, collectors placed near data sources, least‑privilege credentials.
    

**Near Real‑Time Visibility.**

- **What:** Frequent polling or event‑driven updates maintain fresh records.
    
- **Why:** Reduces blind spots, shortens detection and response cycles.
    
- **How:** change capture, webhooks, incremental syncs; freshness indicators per record.
    

**Continuous Assurance.**

- **What:** Always‑on checks against security baselines, EOL catalogs, and configuration standards.
    
- **Why:** Prevents drift; provides audit evidence.
    
- **How:** rule engine evaluates assets; violations create findings with severity and owner.
    

**Risk Scoring (ApexaiQ Score 60–180).**

- **What:** Composite score reflecting posture (higher is better). Example mapping: <90 high risk, 90–130 medium, >130 low.
    
- **How:** weighted factors such as unsupported OS, critical CVEs, missing encryption, internet exposure. Provide transparency via factor breakdown per asset/group.
    
- **Metrics:** average score by BU; % assets above target; variance week‑over‑week.
    
- **Pitfalls:** opaque scoring; ignoring business criticality in weights.
    

**Automation.**

- **What:** Policy‑driven actions (e.g., create ticket, quarantine device, enforce encryption, trigger patch job).
    
- **Why:** Scale remediation; reduce manual toil; enforce consistency.
    
- **How:** rule → condition → action; uses outbound integrations (ITSM, MDM, EDR, CM tools).
    
- **Controls:** dry‑run, approval workflows, guardrails (scoped actions, rate limits).
    

**Example Workflow.** Detect unsupported Windows → tag as EOL → open change in ITSM → schedule OS upgrade → verify compliance → close.

**Roles & responsibilities.** Platform Owner (integrations), Security (rules), ITAM (taxonomy), Ops (playbooks).

**Artifacts & metrics.** Policy catalog, exception register, automation success rate, rollback rate.
