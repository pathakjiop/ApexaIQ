**What it is.** ApexaiQ is a cloud‑based, **agentless** and **continuous asset assurance platform** that consolidates asset inventory, security posture, and automation into one SaaS control plane.

**Why it matters.** Organizations struggle with fragmented visibility and stale inventories. ApexaiQ reduces manual effort, shortens time‑to‑discover risky assets, and standardizes remediation at scale.

**How it works (high level).**

- **Collect** device, user, and software data via integrations and network‑side collectors (no endpoint agents).
    
- **Normalize & enrich** with rules to create a single, deduplicated system of record.
    
- **Assess risk** using posture analytics (e.g., unsupported OS, missing patches, misconfigurations).
    
- **Automate** remediation through policy‑driven actions and outbound integrations.
    

**Roles & responsibilities.**

- **Platform Owner:** configures collectors, integrations, and access controls.
    
- **ITAM Lead:** validates inventory quality, taxonomy, ownership, lifecycle data.
    
- **Security Analyst:** tunes risk logic, exceptions, and escalation paths.
    
- **Ops/SME:** executes remediation playbooks; monitors automation.
    

**Metrics & artifacts.** Asset coverage %, inventory freshness, deduplication rate, mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to remediate (MTTR), policy compliance %, exception register.

**Pitfalls & anti‑patterns.**

- Treating ApexaiQ as a static CMDB export rather than a **continuous** source.
    
- Over‑reliance on defaults without tailoring enrichment rules to business context.
    

**Quick checklist.**

- Define ownership model (business owner, technical owner, support group).
    
- Map top 5 critical systems (“crown jewels”).
    
- Establish weekly review of posture deltas and automation outcomes.
