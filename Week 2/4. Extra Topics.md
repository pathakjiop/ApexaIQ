## 1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### ðŸ”¹ Definition

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a systematic process used by software engineers and teams to **design, develop, test, and deploy** high-quality software efficiently and cost-effectively.

### ðŸ”¹ Purpose

- To ensure software meets customer expectations.
    
- To maintain **consistency**, **quality**, and **predictability** in projects.
    
- To provide a clear roadmap and deliverables at each stage.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Phases of SDLC

|Phase|Description|Key Deliverables|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Requirement Analysis**|Understand what needs to be built through stakeholder communication.|SRS (Software Requirement Specification)|
|**2. System Design**|Define architecture, data models, and UI/UX.|Design Documents, ER Diagrams|
|**3. Implementation (Coding)**|Developers write code following standards and guidelines.|Source Code|
|**4. Testing**|Verify software quality, functionality, and security.|Test Reports, Bug Logs|
|**5. Deployment**|Release the software to the live environment.|Release Build|
|**6. Maintenance**|Fix issues, update features, and optimize performance post-release.|Patch Updates, Maintenance Reports|

### ðŸ”¹ Common SDLC Models

- **Waterfall Model** â€“ Sequential and rigid, best for fixed requirements.
    
- **Iterative Model** â€“ Allows repeating stages for gradual improvement.
    
- **Spiral Model** â€“ Combines iterative and risk analysis approaches.
    
- **V-Model** â€“ Verification and validation happen in parallel.
    
- **Agile Model** â€“ Flexible, adaptive, and iterative.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits

- Improved project visibility
    
- Early defect detection
    
- Efficient resource utilization
    
- Enhanced client satisfaction

## 2. Agile Basics

### ðŸ”¹ Definition

**Agile** is an iterative software development methodology emphasizing **collaboration**, **customer feedback**, and **rapid delivery** of small, functional software increments.

### ðŸ”¹ Core Principles (from Agile Manifesto)

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
    
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
    
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
    
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Key Agile Frameworks

|Framework|Description|Example Tools|
|---|---|---|
|**Scrum**|Divides work into short cycles called _Sprints_ (2â€“4 weeks).|Jira, Trello|
|**Kanban**|Focuses on continuous flow with visual task boards.|Notion, ClickUp|
|**Extreme Programming (XP)**|Emphasizes coding best practices and customer involvement.|GitHub Projects|

### ðŸ”¹ Agile Roles

- **Product Owner:** Defines product vision and priorities.
    
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates processes and removes blockers.
    
- **Development Team:** Builds and tests the product.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Ceremonies in Scrum

- Sprint Planning
    
- Daily Standup (15-min sync)
    
- Sprint Review
    
- Sprint Retrospective
    

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits

- Faster delivery and feedback
    
- Higher flexibility
    
- Improved collaboration and morale

## 3. Version Control

### ðŸ”¹ Definition

**Version Control Systems (VCS)** track and manage changes to source code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently.

### ðŸ”¹ Types of VCS

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Centralized VCS (CVCS)**|One central repository; developers check in/out files.|SVN, CVS|
|**Distributed VCS (DVCS)**|Each developer has a full copy of the repository.|Git, Mercurial|

### ðŸ”¹ Common Git Commands

|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`git init`|Initialize a new repository|
|`git clone <url>`|Copy a remote repository|
|`git add .`|Stage changes|
|`git commit -m "message"`|Save changes|
|`git push origin main`|Upload commits to remote|
|`git pull`|Fetch and merge updates|
|`git branch`, `git merge`|Manage branches|

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits

- Full project history tracking
    
- Easy rollback to previous versions
    
- Enables branching and parallel development
    
- Promotes collaboration and code review
    

### ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

- Use meaningful commit messages
    
- Commit frequently, but logically
    
- Avoid pushing directly to `main` â€” use pull requests
    
- Tag release versions

## 4. Software Architecture

### ðŸ”¹ Definition

**Software Architecture** defines the **high-level structure** of a system â€” including its components, relationships, and design principles guiding its evolution.

### ðŸ”¹ Goals

- Ensure **scalability**, **performance**, and **maintainability**.
    
- Align technical design with business goals.
    
- Serve as a blueprint for development and deployment.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Common Architectural Styles

|Architecture Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Monolithic**|All modules are tightly integrated into one codebase.|Early web apps|
|**Layered (N-tier)**|Divides system into layers (Presentation, Business, Data).|Java EE applications|
|**Microservices**|Independent, loosely coupled services communicating via APIs.|Netflix, Uber|
|**Event-driven**|Services react to events asynchronously.|Kafka-based systems|
|**Serverless**|Executes code in response to events without managing servers.|AWS Lambda|

### ðŸ”¹ Key Architectural Components

- **Frontend:** User interface or client layer.
    
- **Backend:** Business logic and data handling.
    
- **Database:** Persistent data storage.
    
- **API Layer:** Communication bridge between frontend and backend.
    
- **Load Balancer / Proxy:** Ensures availability and performance.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Design Principles

- **SOLID** â€“ Maintainable and extendable OOP design.
    
- **DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)** â€“ Avoid redundancy.
    
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** â€“ Favor simplicity over complexity.
    
- **Scalability** â€“ System should handle growth efficiently.
    
- **Loose Coupling & High Cohesion** â€“ Independent, focused modules.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Documentation Artifacts

- Architecture Diagrams (C4 Model, UML)
    
- API Contracts
    
- Deployment Blueprints
    
- Infrastructure Diagrams (Cloud-based or On-premise)
