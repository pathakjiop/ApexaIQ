# Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## Overview
Architectural patterns for building software applications, representing two fundamentally different approaches to system design.

## Monolithic Architecture

### Definition
A single, unified codebase where all application components are tightly coupled and deployed as one unit.

### Characteristics
- **Single Codebase**: All features in one repository
- **Unified Database**: Typically one database serving entire application
- **Tight Coupling**: Components depend heavily on each other
- **Single Deployment**: Entire application deployed at once

### Advantages
- **Simpler Development**: Easy to start and develop
- **Easier Testing**: End-to-end testing straightforward
- **Simple Deployment**: Single artifact to deploy
- **Consistent Data**: ACID transactions across entire application

### Disadvantages
- **Scalability Challenges**: Must scale entire application
- **Technology Lock-in**: Hard to adopt new technologies
- **Development Bottlenecks**: Large teams face coordination issues
- **Single Point of Failure**: One bug can bring down entire system

## Microservices Architecture

### Definition
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

### Characteristics
- **Service Separation**: Each service has specific business capability
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed separately
- **Decentralized Data**: Each service manages its own database
- **API Communication**: Services communicate via well-defined APIs

### Advantages
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale only needed services
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different tech stacks
- **Faster Development**: Teams can work independently
- **Fault Isolation**: One service failure doesn't crash entire system

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Distributed system challenges
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency vs ACID transactions
- **Operational Overhead**: Requires sophisticated DevOps practices

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Monolithic | Microservices |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Development** | Single team, single codebase | Multiple teams, multiple codebases |
| **Deployment** | Single deployment unit | Independent deployments |
| **Scaling** | Vertical scaling | Horizontal scaling |
| **Database** | Shared database | Database per service |
| **Technology** | Homogeneous stack | Heterogeneous stack |

## When to Choose Which?

### Choose Monolithic When:
- Small team or startup
- Simple application
- Tight deadlines
- Limited operational expertise

### Choose Microservices When:
- Large, distributed teams
- Complex domain with clear boundaries
- Need for different scaling requirements
- Willing to invest in DevOps infrastructure

## Migration Considerations
- Start with monolith, extract services gradually
- Identify bounded contexts
- Plan for interservice communication
- Implement proper monitoring and logging
