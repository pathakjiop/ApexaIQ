## Overview
A release management strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments (Blue and Green).

## Core Concept

### Definition
Blue-Green deployment involves maintaining two identical production environments:
- **Blue**: Current live environment
- **Green**: New version ready for deployment

Only one environment is live at any time, with traffic routed between them.

## How It Works

### Basic Flow
1. **Current State**: Blue environment is live, serving all traffic
2. **Deployment**: Deploy new version to Green environment
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test Green environment
4. **Switch**: Router switches traffic from Blue to Green
5. **Rollback**: If issues, switch back to Blue immediately

### Environment Setup
User Traffic → Load Balancer/Router  
↓  
[Blue] [Green]  
(v1.0) (v1.1)  
Live Standby

## Key Components

### 1. Infrastructure
- Identical hardware/resources for both environments
- Shared database (with backward compatibility) or separate data migration strategy

### 2. Router/Load Balancer
- Controls traffic routing between environments
- Can be hardware or software-based (Nginx, HAProxy, cloud load balancers)

### 3. Deployment Automation
- Automated provisioning of environments
- Consistent deployment processes

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Initial Setup
```bash
# Set up two identical environments
blue-environment:
  - servers, databases, networking
green-environment:
  - identical 
```

### Step 2: Deployment Process
```bash
# 1. Deploy to green environment
deploy --environment green --version 2.0

# 2. Run tests
test --environment green

# 3. Switch traffic
router switch --from blue --to green

# 4. Monitor new version
monitor --environment green
```

### Step 3: Rollback Procedure

```bash
# If issues detected
router switch --from green --to blue
```

## Benefits

### 1. Zero Downtime

- Seamless switching between environments
    
- No interruption for end users
    

### 2. Instant Rollback

- Quick reversal to previous version
    
- Minimal impact during failures
    

### 3. Safe Testing

- Production-like testing environment
    
- Real-world testing before going live
    

### 4. Reduced Risk

- Isolated deployment and testing
    
- Gradual traffic shifting possible
    

## Challenges

### 1. Infrastructure Cost

- Double the infrastructure resources
    
- Cost management considerations
    

### 2. Database Management

- Schema changes require careful planning
    
- Data migration strategies needed
    

### 3. Session Management

- User sessions may be affected during switch
    
- Stateless applications work best
    

### 4. Configuration Management

- Keeping environments identical
    
- Environment-specific configurations
    

## Best Practices

### 1. Automated Deployment
```yaml
# Example CI/CD pipeline
stages:
  - deploy_green
  - test_green
  - switch_traffic
  - cleanup_blue
```

### 2. Database Strategy

- Backward-compatible database changes
    
- Use feature flags for risky changes
    
- Plan rollback scripts
    

### 3. Monitoring

- Real-time monitoring during switch
    
- Key metrics: error rates, response times, throughput
    

### 4. Traffic Switching Options

- **Instant Switch**: All traffic at once
    
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradual traffic shift
    
- **Percentage-based**: Slowly increase green traffic
